## The microcontroller I use to work:
![arduino nano](https://http2.mlstatic.com/D_NQ_NP_749009-MLA49705588229_042022-O.jpg, "Arduino Nano")
## Description:
Thanks to this module connected to arduino nano via i2c protocol, I received the following data from the sensor:
+ Date and time
+ Distance to the Lviv Polytechnic National University
+ Speed in km per hour
+ Number of connected satellites
+ Horizontal accuracy
+ Longitude and latitude
+ and others.
## Main purpose:
I connected this sensor to implement it in my Smart GPS Tracker for Dogs project. The data obtained from this module will help to track the location of the animal, its activity and distance to a specific target set by the user.
